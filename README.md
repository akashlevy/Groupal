#Groupal
####Introduction

Before we ever even attended college, we were always bombarded by this idea: College was hard, but it was easy to find people in your classes to study with. When we came in, this idea was everpresent and looming, but weeks went by and we were no closer to finding a study group. To this day, studying can often be a solitary task of secluded problem solving and mind-numbing scanning of dozens if not hundreds of pages.

#####**There had to be a better way.**

Groupal came out of that ardent desire to do better, to be better. People working together just works. But if it's so hard to find someone to study with, what are you left to do? 

Right now, there is no help and no aid. But there can be. There will be. It's called Groupal, and it's here. 

####**How Does Groupal Work?**
You're having a bad day. You just failed your first math quiz at Princeton. A 25/50 in Multivariable Calculus. You're good at this. How did you do so poorly? Yes, the average was a 30, but your entire self-esteem has been here. Are you really supposed to be here?

Yes. Yes, you are.

You just need to do better. With Groupal.

You log on to our website. You put in your ID and you're brought to a screen with a large orange "Groupal" in the middle and a search bar to find your class. Your fingers slip onto the black plastic of your keyboard and type in "M". "A". "T". "2". "0". "1". Instantly five study groups pop up in front of your eyes and your pupils dilate in anticapation. Which one is best for you? Hm. It looks like this one only has one more spot. Why not take it? As soon as your index finger presses down on the mouse pad, an alert sounds from your phone. It vibrates in your pocket and you take it out.

You've just been added to a GroupMe. One made for your study group. You do belong, you just had to find where.

##**Future Directions **

Groupal can take a life of its own. 

There's no need to restrict it to simply finding GroupMe's. We want it to be able to automate events planning. With just a few clicks, a meeting time and place are set. It can send you an alert a day in advance, 10 minutes in advance, it doesn't matter. As often or as little as you want in order to remember your study time. 

Beyond that, we want better integration with GroupMe. Adding a GroupMe frame into the website itself that lets you chat within Groupal would be best.

For a more comprehensive list of future features, we plan to include:
* Bots which can add or remove trolls or spammers from a group
* Removing a user from a GroupMe removes them from that study group on Groupal
* Creating a maximum number of groups one can join per course
* Creating a maximum number of classes for each users (one can only have so many classes a semester after all)
* Filtering by preceptors
* Creating an official schedule for each user based on events in GroupMe
* Integrating GroupMe events with a user's calendar (either on Google Calendar or their specific phone calendar)
* Deleting a group when there are no more users

Dependencies: 
* Php5
* CodeIgniter 
* Jquery
* Jqueryui
* GroupMe API 
* GroupMePHP wrapper 
* CAS
